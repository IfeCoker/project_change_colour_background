# project_change_colour_background
A beginner JavaScript project to change the background color of an app using:
HTML
CSS
BootStrap4 for styling the button
JavaScript for adding and handling event to the button

Steps for the JS code:
- Used JS selectors
- used JS to style CSS (element.style.backgroundColor)
- created an array of colours

Once the button is clicked, a different background colour appears.
